        <h2>Coolie Movie Review: A thumping ode to Rajinikanth’s legacy—packed with energy, nostalgia, and mass appeal</h2>
        <div class="review">
            <p >Coolie Movie Plot: Deva, aka Devaraj (Rajinikanth), is the charismatic owner of Deva Mansion, a haven where students can stay at discounted rates. When his close friend Rajshekhar (Sathyaraj) suddenly dies of a cardiac arrest, Deva stumbles upon the original death certificate — and the truth is far from natural. It reveals his friend died from an injury, not illness. Determined to uncover the killer, Deva infiltrates a smuggling ring in Visakhapatnam. But in chasing justice, he inadvertently unlocks a hidden chapter of his own past — one filled with secrets, unfinished business, and dangerous loose ends that demand closure.<br><br>
            Coolie Movie Review: The film opens at a bustling port in Vizag, where Kingpin Simon (Nagarjuna) and his aide Dayal (Soubin Shahir) run an illegal operation. After a police diktat stops them from disposing of bodies at sea, they turn to Rajshekhar (Sathyaraj), a former laborer who has invented a chair capable of cremating bodies instantly, leaving only ashes. Originally discarded by the government for its dangerous potential, the invention now falls into the wrong hands. When Rajshekhar is killed, his longtime friend Deva (Rajinikanth), who had been working in the background, steps into the fray. What begins as a mission to uncover his friend’s murderer soon unravels secrets from Deva’s own past, tying old loose ends to the present conflict.<br><br>
            The first half of Coolie leans heavily into fan service — complete with songs, dances, punch dialogues, and a fair share of swagger. While it slows the film’s momentum and spends a bit too long introducing characters who could have been set up more briskly, the second half is where Lokesh really gets cooking and serves up a treat. Multiple cameos here not only land perfectly but also add real weight to the story, with well-timed twists keeping the audience hooked.<br><br>
            Despite its extended runtime, Coolie roars as a tribute to Rajinikanth’s legacy — brimming with energy, nostalgia, and unfiltered mass appeal. Learning from the pacing missteps of his last outing, director Lokesh Kanagaraj crafts a tighter, more impactful second half, putting his pan-India stars to good use with well-etched, purposeful characters. Nagarjuna, as drug lord Simon, embraces his villainy with calculated finesse, while Soubin Shahir proves to be another inspired casting choice whose screen presence lingers. Rachita Ram’s surprise role emerges as the scene-stealer — effortlessly commanding the frame and delivering one of the smoothest, most organic action sequences in the film. Upendra exudes effortless swagger as Rajini’s silent yet formidable right-hand man, matching the superstar’s presence blow for blow in the high-octane set pieces.<br><br>
            Rajinikanth, of course, delivers exactly what fans crave — charisma, style, and a commanding screen presence that feels effortless. The flashback portions, especially the Rajini–Sathyaraj sequences, are a treat, as the two icons come together on screen after 40 years. Sathyaraj and Shruti Haasan bring solid support, never tipping into excess, while the mass appeal and emotional beats keep the second half gripping, with well-timed outbursts landing just right. The de-aging of Rajinikanth is pure mass — seamlessly done, it adds a nostalgic punch. Shruthi’s character is the anchor of the film. Even Aamir Khan’s cameo is smartly placed, adding intrigue without feeling forced. Lokesh seems to have learned from the tonal missteps of his previous outing, striking a smarter balance this time. He directs Rajinikanth with the enthusiasm of a fanboy but never lets it overshadow his own filmmaking sensibilities, blending style, story, and spectacle with confidence. Though this film may not reach the heights of Kaithi or Vikram, it is far from disappointing, delivering a thoroughly entertaining experience that keeps audiences engaged. Anirudh’s music is a highlight — the songs are proper crowd-pleasers, and the BGM elevates action sequences brilliantly, though emotional scenes stick to somewhat stereotypical musical cues.<br><br>
            While the first half could have been tighter, the second half more than compensates, making Coolie a high-energy, nostalgic, and entertaining ride for fans. Coolie emerges as one of Rajinikanth’s most electrifying outings in recent years, surpassing his previous films in sheer energy and style. It caters not just to die-hard fans but also to casual viewers, balancing nostalgia with interesting storytelling. The cameos, in particular, outshine Lokesh’s previous outings, delivering memorable performances that enhance the story without ever feeling forced. With high-octane action, charismatic star power, and well-placed surprises, Coolie is a perfect blend of mass appeal and crowd-pleasing entertainment.<br><br>
            And now, to the million-dollar question — is it part of the LCU? Lokesh cleverly slips in the word “drug” in the film, leaving it to the fans to decide whether to see it as part of the larger universe or enjoy it as a standalone story.</p>
